# Limit 1 edit to a Google Sheet per day, per user

Make sure you have a Google Sheet with the formulas set up on a hidden sheet, and set the sharing settings to only allow people to edit the Google Sheet if they're signed in to an account (need invites). If you make it fully public and allow anonymous edits, then edits won't trigger the automated checks. Also, this doesn't guarantee meddling prevention, but at least helps prevent accidental edits if people forget that they already edited the sheet.
