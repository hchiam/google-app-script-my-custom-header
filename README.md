# Learning Google Apps Script
Just one of the things I'm learning. https://github.com/hchiam/learning

Did you know you can write code to modify things like Google Docs or Google Sheets?

To associate a script to your doc, go to: Tools -> Script editor -> (paste in code like [this](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-google-apps-script/blob/master/popup-minimal-code.gs) and edit it)

You can see all your .gs files listed here: https://script.google.com

## About the examples:

Each .gs file is its own example. Here's a minimal example: [popup in Google Sheets doc](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-google-apps-script/blob/master/popup-minimal-code.gs).

Learn from [a video](https://youtu.be/MOggwSls7xQ) or [the docs](https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/editors/docs/quickstart/translate) or [GitHub examples](https://github.com/gsuitedevs/apps-script-samples) or [Codelabs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/apps-script-intro/).
